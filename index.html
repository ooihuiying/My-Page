        <em> ~The Lantern Festival~</em> <br><br>
        The Lantern Festival or the Spring Lantern Festival is a Chinese festival celebrated on 
        the fifteenth day of the first month in the lunisolar Chinese calendar. Usually falling in February or early March on the Gregorian calendar, it marks the final day of the traditional Chinese New Year celebrations.

        <h3> The Lantern Festival has inspired numerous poetry in ancient China and the poem below is a poem by Xin Qiji, a poet in the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279). </h3>
        
        <em> <b>~The Lantern Festival Night - to the tune of Green Jade Table~</b></em> <br><br>
        During the night the East wind blew open thousands of silver flowers<br>
        and blew down fireworks like stars and raindrops on the floor.<br>
        Ornate carriages and treasured horses full of fragrance fill the roads.<br>
        The sound of the flute quivers. <br>
        The moon shining in the sky like a jade teapot is turning.<br>
        The fishes and dragons dance for the whole night.<br>
        Beautiful maidens with exquisite head ornaments and gold-threaded clothes.<br>
        The sound of their laughter and speech abound as they leave behind fading fragrances.<br>
        Having searched for her hundreds and thousands of times,<br>
        I turned back abruptly - There she is <br>
        where all the lights are waning. <br>
